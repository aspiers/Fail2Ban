fail2ban (0.5.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made failregex'es more specific to don't allow usernames to be used as a
    tool for denial of service attacks. Config files (or at least
    failregex'es) must be updated from this package, otherwise the security
    breach would remain open and only warning gets issued (closes: #330827)

fail2ban (0.5.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Resolved the mistery of debug mode in which commands are not really
    executed: added verbose option to config file, removed -v from
    /etc/default/fail2ban, reordered code a bit so that log targets are
    setup right after background and then only loglevel (verbose,debug) is
    processed, so the warning could be seen in the logs

fail2ban (0.5.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now exporting PATH explicitely in init.d/fail2ban script, to avoid
    problems finding iptables in the cases when PATH was not exported outside
    (cfengine, broken shell environment) (closes: #329304)
  * Removed -b from start-stop-daemon because fail2ban detahes on its own
  * Added @localhost to MAIL:from and MAIL:to in fail2ban.conf and placed
    a note to README.Debian regarding necessity to specify full email
    address in MAIL:from (closes: #329722)
  * Added a keyword <section> in parsing of the subject and the body of an
    email sent out by fail2ban (closes: #330311)
