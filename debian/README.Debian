fail2ban for Debian
-------------------

This package is nearly 100% identical to the upstream version. It was
merely packaged to be installed on a Debian system and due to tight
collaboration with upstream author most of the Debian modifications
penetrate into the next upstream.

Currently the main difference with upstream: python libraries are
placed under /usr/share/fail2ban insteadh of /usr/lib/fail2ban to
comply with policy regarding architecture independent resources.

See the file TODO.Debian for more details, as well as the Debian Bug
Tracking system.
