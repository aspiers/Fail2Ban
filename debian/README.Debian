fail2ban for Debian
-------------------

This package is nearly 100% identical to the upstream version. It was
merely packaged to be installed on a Debian system and due to tight
collaboration with upstream author most of the Debian modifications
penetrate into the next upstream.

Currently the main difference with upstream: python libraries are
placed under /usr/share/fail2ban insteadh of /usr/lib/fail2ban to
comply with policy regarding architecture independent resources.

Only handling of ssh files is enabled by default. If you want to use
fail2ban with apache, please enable apache section manually in
/etc/fail2ban.conf.

Currently no checks if an iptables queue generated at the beginning
(fail2ban-http and fail2ban-ssh) exists. So if your firewall resets
the iptable rules -- it is your responsibility to restart fail2ban.

See  TODO.Debian for more details, as well as the Debian Bug
Tracking system.
