fail2ban for Debian
-------------------

This package is nearly 100% identical to the upstream version. It was
merely packaged to be installed on a Debian system and due to tight
collaboration with upstream author most of the Debian modifications
penetrate into the next upstream.

Currently the main difference with upstream: python libraries are
placed under /usr/share/fail2ban insteadh of /usr/lib/fail2ban to
comply with policy regarding architecture independent resources.

Default behavior:
-----------------

Only handling of ssh files is enabled by default. If you want to use
fail2ban with apache, please enable apache section manually in
/etc/fail2ban.conf.

Troubleshooting:
---------------

Updated failregex:

To resolve the security bug #330827 [1] failregex expressions must
provide a named group (?P<host>...) as a placeholder of the abuser's
host. The naming of the group was introduced to capture possible
future generalizations of failregex to provide even more
information. At a current point, all named groups are considered as
possible locations of the host addresses, but usually you should need
just a single group (?P<host>...)

Broken chain:

Currently no checks if an iptables queue generated at the beginning
(fail2ban-http and fail2ban-ssh) exists. So if your firewall resets the iptable
rules -- it is your responsibility to restart fail2ban.  Also you can
augment fwban and fwunban rules and include as first lines full
definitions of fwstart. That is nasty solution and probably it will get
resolved in the future.

Mailing:

As it was reported (bug #329722) you might need to provide a full
e-mail address in fail2ban.conf option MAIL:from to make your mail
server accept that email. I've added @localhost to both MAIL:from and
MAIL:to in the default configuration shipped with Debian. It seems to
work nicely now

See TODO.Debian for more details, as well as the Debian Bug Tracking
system.
