fail2ban (0.6.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  In this version the new section ApacheAttacks was introduced to ban IPs
  which are found to run some known attack on the host. For now it captures
  just awstats related attacks. Besides that to make it function the bug of
  wrongly specified timeregexp for Apache's access.log file was fixed.
  Besides that group of log files has changed to be adm, and now they are
  readable by the group
