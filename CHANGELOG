Fail2Ban (version 0.6.1)                           2006/03/16
=============================================================

ver. 0.6.1 (2006/03/16) - stable
----------
- Added permanent banning. Set banTime to a negative value to
  enable this feature (-1 is perfect). Thanks to Mannone
- Fixed locale bug. Thanks to Fernando JosÃ©
- Fixed crash when time format does not match data
- Propagated patch from Debian to fix fail2ban search path 
  addition to the path search list: now it is added first. 
  Thanks to Nick Craig-Wood
- Added SMTP authentification for mail notification. Thanks
  to Markus Hoffmann
- Removed debug mode as it is confusing for people
- Added parsing of timestamp in TAI64N format (#1275325).
  Thanks to Mark Edgington
- Added patch #1382936 (Default formatted syslog logging).
  Thanks to Patrick Börjesson
- Removed 192.168.0.0/16 from ignoreip. Attacks could also
  come from the local network.
- Robust startup: if iptables module does not get fully
  initialized after startup of fail2ban, fail2ban will do
  "maxreinit" attempts to initialize its own firewall. It
  will sleep between attempts for "polltime" number of
  seconds (closes Debian: #334272). Thanks to Yaroslav
  Halchenko
- Added "interpolations" in fail2ban.conf. This is provided
  by the ConfigParser module. Old configuration files still
  work. Thanks to Yaroslav Halchenko
- Added initial support for hosts.deny and shorewall. Need
  more testing. Please test. Thanks to kojiro from Gentoo
  forum for hosts.deny support
- Added support for vsftpd. Thanks to zugeschmiert

ver. 0.6.0 (2005/11/20) - stable
----------
- Propagated patches introduced by Debian maintainer 
  (Yaroslav Halchenko):

    or GMT in mail notification.

ver. 0.5.5 (2005/10/26) - beta
----------
- Propagated patches introduced by Debian maintainer 
  (Yaroslav Halchenko):

    chains. Implemented automatic restart of fail2ban main
    function in case check of fwban or fwunban command failed
    (closes: #329163, #331695). (Introduced patch was further
    adjusted by upstream author).
  * Added -f command line parameter for [findtime].
  * Added a cleanup of firewall rules on emergency shutdown
    when unknown exception is catched.
  * Fail2ban should not crash now if a wrong file name is
    specified in config.
  * reordered code a bit so that log targets are setup right
    after background and then only loglevel (verbose, debug)
    is processed, so the warning could be seen in the logs
  * Added a keyword <section> in parsing of the subject and
    the body of an email sent out by fail2ban (closes:
    #330311)

ver. 0.5.4 (2005/09/13) - beta
----------
- Fixed bug #1286222.

    to any SYSLOG target and facility as directed by the 
    config
  * Format of SYSLOG entries fixed to look closer to standard
  * Fixed errata in config/gentoo-confd
  * Introduced findtime configuration variable to control the
    lifetime of caught "failed" log entries
